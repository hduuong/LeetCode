We have to maximize the Area that can be formed between the vertical lines using the shorter line 
as length and the distance between the lines as the width of the rectangle forming the area.

public static int maxArea(int[] heights) {
    int res = 0, lo = 0, hi = heights.length - 1;
    while (lo < hi) {
        res = Math.max(res, Math.min(heights[lo], heights[hi]) * (hi-lo));
        if (heights[lo] < heights[hi) {
            lo++;
        } else {
            hi--;
        }
    }
    return res;
}
