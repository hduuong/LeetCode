A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: m and n will be at most 100

public static int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
    int[] map = new int[m][n];
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        map[i][0] = 1;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        map[0][i] = 1;
    }
    
    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            map[i][j] = map[i-1][j] + map[i][j-1];
        }
    }
    return map[n-1][m-1];
}
